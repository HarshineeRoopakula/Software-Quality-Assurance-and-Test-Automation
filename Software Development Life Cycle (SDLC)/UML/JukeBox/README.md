## Description
Design a Juke Box that allows customers to select songs they want played or to submit a play list that they have already created previously. If a request is made for song that is not contained by a local Juke Box, it will query for that song from other Jukeboxes elsewhere in the country - thus they are networked. Although reminiscent of Napster, like the original jukebox, we want to provide a mechanism for owners, record companies and artists to earn a profit. Therefore, for this Juke Box we want to provide not only a coin drop and cash feed mechanism, but also a card swipe mechanism and a cell dial payment capability.
